          <div class="visualizationAnalysis">This graph highlights the number of traffic accidents that occur over the week between 10pm and 4am. The vast majority of accidents occur on the weekend. This is likely due to the fact that there are more drunk drivers in the late nights and early morning during the weekend.</div>  
          <div class="visualizationAnalysis">Extrapolating on the data from the line graph, this graph displays which districts have the most traffic accidents late at night. The districts with a high number of accidents likely have more of a nightlife scene, and as a result, should be avoided by drivers late at night.</div>   
          <div class="visualizationAnalysis">This graph helps to visualize the most dangerous times to be on the road late at night. It shows that the majority of accidents that occur late at night occur at around 11:00pm and 2:00am. Cautious drivers should avoid driving around these hours as these time periods are the most likely for an accident to occur in.</div>

        <div id="responseAnalysis">The areas with the longest wait time are districts 6 and 7. As the table shows, within districts 6 and 7 the most frequent response units needed are fire engines and medics. Fire engines and medics are also needed almost an equal number of times in both districts. As a result, reducing the response time in these districts can be acheived by providing an equal number of additional medic and fire engine units to these districts so as to reduce the time required for the most frequent type of calls.</div>

        <div class="frequencyAnalysis">The markers in the map above are placed by determining the point in a district that is closest to all calls that occur within that district that require fire engines or medics. There is only one marker to represent both fire engines and medics because the point that is closest to all calls requiring fire engines is almost identical to the point that is closest to all calls requiring medics for all districts.</div>
